# UI Refactoring Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the legacy monolithic UI to the new modular UI architecture.

## Current Status

The UI refactoring is underway with the following progress:

- ✅ Core modules implemented (Events.js, DOMUtils.js, ColorUtils.js)
- ✅ Base UIComponent class implemented
- ✅ UIManager implemented
- ✅ Initial component implementations:
  - ✅ CanvasControls
  - ✅ EditModeControls
  - ✅ ColorControls
  - ✅ DistortionControls
  - ✅ SwatchManager

## Migration Strategy

The migration will follow these steps:

1. **Parallel Operation Phase** (Current)
   - New modular system runs alongside the legacy UI
   - Legacy UI is still the primary controller
   - Both systems share the same meshGradient instance
   - Components are gradually moved from legacy to modular system

2. **Feature Parity Phase**
   - Each component in the modular system reaches feature parity with legacy code
   - Components are tested individually to ensure functionality
   - UI events are properly routed through the new event bus

3. **Transition Phase**
   - Modular system becomes the primary controller
   - Legacy code is selectively disabled
   - User-facing functionality is maintained throughout

4. **Legacy Removal Phase**
   - Legacy UI code is removed completely
   - Only modular system remains
